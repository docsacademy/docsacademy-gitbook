The process of creating documentation with DITA can be described as follows:

* In the first step, so-called DITA topics are created that contain relevant content.
* Next, DITA maps are defined that determine which topics should be included in which final documents.
* Finally, the output format of the final documents is specified (PDF, HTML, ePub, etc.).
