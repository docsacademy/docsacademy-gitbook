DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) is an open standard developed in the late 20th century by
IBM. In 2005, OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) took over the
rights for further development of the standard. Version 1 of the DITA specification was released in 2005.
Versions 1.1 and 1.2 followed in 2007 and 2010, respectively.

DITA is an XML application for creating, organizing, and managing content based on the following principles:

* Modular content creation in the form of topics
* Separation of content and formatting
* Minimalism
* A structured approach to the creation of documentation

Since this is an XML application, you can use any text editor to work with DITA files.
